# map

here is my [first map using mapbox](https://apurvaraman.github.io/maps/week2assets/vector-map-with-data.html)

# on exploring datasets:

I haven't worked with geojson data before, so I took the opportunity to look through a few different datasets. I narrowed things down by deciding I would use data.gov as a source. which meant I was limiting myself to the US context. With that limitation in mind, I knew I wanted to work with a federal data set. A lot of these are massive and hard to work with. I wanted a data set with a substantial amount of features, but I wasn't aiming to say anything in particular (in contrast to my first map). This really was just a sort of wandering through data.

I then happened upon the "Tribal Lands Ceded to the United States" data set. I found the title interesting, but wasn't really sure what to expect. I'm also curious why this data set comes from the Forest Service. I would like to know more about how government departments come to be in charge of certain data.

When I brought the map into mapbox, I had the opacity of all the polygons at 0.9. At first I didn't realized how much overlap there was in certain areas (surely the US wouldn't take the same land multiple times?) but when I reduced the opacity, I was really surprised to see there were so many areas with multiple overlaps.

I looked for the data source and started looking through [this report](https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwss-ilc.html). This data comes from a report Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1896-1897, and is also part of a serial set. The report contains several maps and reports which have been digitized and turned into a polygons in geojson.

I started skimming through the opening essay by Cyrus Thomas and found it to be repeatedly surprising. It's strange to read this kind of document from this time- in some sections it seems like it's coming from a much older essay, and in others it seems to be far more contemporary. Although it acknowledges that the rights of various tribes were overcome by the colonialist land grab, he nevertheless believes that they were "savages" and couldn't be negotiated with like "civilized nations". The essay starts with discussing the paradigm of right to land by "discovery" and how that right was to establish boundaries and dominance between colonial powers and largely ignored the people already there. He made the point that even very Catholic nations did not declare their right to land as coming from the Pope or from the Church or from God, but followed the "discovery" paradigm, which I found really interesting. He talks about how many think that recognizing Native American nations as separate nationalities is a "political myth" but he thinks it was the best thing to do at the time, although he seems to be skeptical that it was necessary or that these nations can actually function effectively separately. That seems to me to be a sort of self-fulfilling notion; once you think a group can't be treated seriously and you have power, you end up disenfranchising them and limiting their ability to function effectively.

I didn't make it that far into the report, and I don't have an answer to the question about how the overlaps happened and what they mean, but I feel like I have a starting place to explore those questions. I don't think I would have ever looked at a report like this without it having been turned into such a dataset that led me to ask questions about how these borders (the ceded land, but also borders of definition for things like discovery and for "moralistic" notions or other things Thomas discusses) got drawn.

# on Trap Streets:

"Argleton will likely exist forever, passed from one database to another, a set of gently corroding place marks wandering the face of the earth."

This idea is somehow very beautiful. I can't help but be delighted by the inertia of this ridiculous data.
The idea of a tool designed to track copying (and stop copying) becoming unstoppably copied makes it feel alive.

# on Seeing Like a State:

(writing as I read)

First of all, that forestry metaphor was a bit shocking after finding an interesting historical dataset that was apparently digitized under the purview of the Forest Service.

Also, that little excerpt from the Epic of Gilgamesh. I know I'm not meant to dwell on it, but if I recall correctly Gilgamesh and Enkidu go and cut down Humbaba's Cedar Forest because they want the big trees to make stuff to take elsewhere. They kill Humbaba even though he offers them the forest after they defeat him. Then they cut down the biggest tree and take the natural resources elsewhere to build stuff. It's a bit on the nose for colonial practices and questions of who land belongs to.

I like the framework of abstraction and simplification being done to serve the state, and the following strategy of thinking in terms of the state (giving you a window into the motivation of the model-making). Where does this strategy for analysis miss the mark?

This idea of the employer of the state as distinct from the state and their interests seems really important, but I'm not sure I understand what that separation is.

The idea of legibility in a forest is at once really absurd and very normal. Regimentation as an aesthetic to signify control is something that shows up everywhere in visual culture and in the built environment.

The comparison between billeting troops and incarceration is one that I haven't encountered. Certainly I see the connection between two militaristic ways of reinforcing class and hierarchy and, as Scott says, "fiscal punishment", but I can't help but feel I'm missing something here.

The politics of measurement and the value laden and embedded in it is an issue we've been dealing with quite a bit in ADE as well. I'm really struggling with it at the moment. A lot of manipulation happens with Social Return on Investment analysis of NGOs and nonprofit social ventures, but it's really hard to figure out what metrics are the right ones. In terms of measurement in the approximation sense, I can't help but think about the Art of Approximation that used to be taught here and the understanding of things as relative to each other, in multiples of each other.

"Centralizing elites" is a good phrase. Standard measurement and standard maps are very related.

Rural communities as fiscally (and in other ways too) illegible is powerful. Informal economies and complex collective systems can sustain a wide range of people with various different needs that a standard system might not.

I'm curious about the politics and power of surveyors.

The idea of the apparent objectivity leading to propagation of assumptions is another thing that's coming up in ADE.
