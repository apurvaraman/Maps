# ideas for a map

Here are some of the things I'm thinking about

1. Co-opting the visual language of the ISG maps and putting them in new contexts

Taking the room guides or the wall text from ISG exhibits and putting them around the city in response to HSTF might be interesting.
Wall text to me feels very much like a map, and sourcing descriptions of places from HSTF and making wall text for them seems like an interesting prospect.
I could also see a room guide being a good response to any of the groups, particularly Sisters and HSTF. I could imagine a web-based tool that allows you to take photographs, street view images, or satellite/osm images and use them in the room guide slots (alternatively, drawing room guide rectangles over an existing map and writing descriptions). These are participatory, but what makes them more interesting than just a series of responses to questions about what places mean to these groups is taking the visual language of the ISG museum and letting that lend authority to the descriptions in a different way.

2. Tiles

I also was very struck by the tiles in the ISG museum and the notion of map tiles becoming actual physical tiles is really appealing. I think this could be an interesting approach with Urbano. Painting on ceramic tiles is one of those classic children's art things. I wonder if we were to make clay tiles of different scales that have map elements carved into them and then fire them, if we could elicit a different response. Carved tiles or tiles with some tactile element could be an interesting surface to walk on or experience in a more visceral way. This could also be a more speculative map that suggests possible futures or even possible pasts (what would the maps of a society that didn't go down the prison route look like?). This might also be interesting from the perspective of Sisters.
