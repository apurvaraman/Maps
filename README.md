Welcome to my blog about maps. This is part of work I'm doing in [Impossible Maps](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/Impossible-Maps).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
